# bulldozer-price-prediction-project

This repository contains code and resources for predicting the price of bulldozers using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate the price of used bulldozers based on various features.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Bulldozers Kaggle competition dataset. It consists of historical sales data of bulldozers, including information such as the sale price, equipment details, and usage information. The dataset contains a training set with labeled examples for model training and an evaluation set for testing and evaluation.
